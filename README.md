Deadpool 3 Director Reveals if There Will Be an Extended Cut

Deadpool 3 helmer Shawn Levy revealed if there will be an extended cut of the Merc With a Mouth's newest cinematic outing. Before this, Levy touched upon how Hugh Jackman's return changed Deadpool 3's story.

Levy brought this topic up while speaking to Collider with leading man Ryan Reynolds, avowing, "This is the cut of the movie. There will be no extended cut because this is the cut that we wanted." Reynolds went on to further note that he had to ask Levy about "doing a Snyder Cut," and Levy didn't seem to feel like that was appropriate or warranted.

Levy also remarked that there are a "small handful of deleted scenes which will be included, as well as a commentary by Ryan and [himself] and a really good gag reel." Reynolds added that the gag reel isn't like bloopers as much as it is "like alt takes and moments because everyone is so professional on this movie." Reynolds further professed that he thinks a lot of people think he just kind of [shows] up and ya pull a string and [he kind of improvs] through the day," commenting that he doesn't.

"We write everything," he concluded. "We write like 10 alternate jokes to any given joke, not just for me, I write jokes for other characters, someone who maybe has never even had a line in the background or whatever. You know, you kind of plot it out in advance. So, seeing some of those alts I think will be really fun for audiences."

Putting the spotlight on Deadpool 3 itself, Levy delved into why he wanted Jackman to wear a comic-accurate Wolverine costume in the project in 2023, professing at the time, "Like the rest of the world, I've waited two decades to see Wolverine in a whole movie with Deadpool, and I don't know if this is our last shot at Wolverine on screen, so I was going to make goddamned sure we get the old yellow and blue just once, and that we get it right."

Only Deadpool Gets to Break the Fourth Wall More recently, Reynolds touched upon why no one else will break the fourth wall in the project, affirming that one would diminish the stakes in the film if everyone was "also aware of the fourth wall or any kind of meta aspect," going on to further note, "Deadpool is the only character who has that ability to do that. If everyone did that, then you would no longer invest in that character as much."

Reynolds concluded that he needs people "as invested as humanly possible in every other character" while knowing that only Deadpool is the unreliable narrator. Jackman jokingly added that Reynolds "beautifully describes Deadpool's brain as a half-baked omelet," and so whatever he's doing, it's just "another layer of annoying crap that [Jackman's] got to put up with."

Deadpool 3 is currently playing in theaters.

The Ending Of ‘Deadpool 3’ Explained

Deadpool 3 takes viewers on a wild ride through the Marvel multiverse, blending irreverent humor with high-stakes action. The film reunites Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and Logan Howlett (Hugh Jackman) as they tackle a multiversal crisis that threatens not only their own universe but the very fabric of reality itself.

The film opens with a dynamic sequence where Deadpool 3, driven by his relentless quest to revive his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and his X-Force team, inadvertently attracts the attention of the Time Variance Authority (TVA). This leads to an unexpected partnership with a disillusioned Wolverine, who is struggling with his own sense of purpose.

As the plot unfolds, the TVA's new rogue agent, Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen), seeks to erase the X-Men universe using a powerful device known as the Time Ripper. Deadpool 3 must navigate this chaotic landscape, balancing humor with their quest to save their universe. The film is notable for its meta-commentary on the state of reboots and sequels, playfully critiquing Hollywood’s penchant for nostalgia while indulging in fan service.

A crucial plot point is Deadpool 3’s interaction with the TVA and his unsuccessful attempt to join the Avengers. His rejection by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and subsequent existential crisis add depth to his character, highlighting his struggle with imposter syndrome.

The climax of the film sees Deadpool 3 battling against Paradox and Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), preventing them from using the Time Ripper to destroy their universe. This confrontation results in a transformative moment for Wolverine, who steps into the role of the new Anchor for the X-Men universe, taking over from his tragic predecessor.

Deadpool 3’s journey through the multiverse leads him to a new Wolverine, a failed hero who dons a comic-accurate costume in a nod to his fallen friends. This character arc emphasizes the themes of redemption and legacy, offering a poignant reflection on heroism.

Deadpool 3 & Wolverine ends with the titular heroes still in their original universe, hinting at future adventures. The end-credits scene teases the possibility of Deadpool 3 entering the MCU, setting up potential crossovers in upcoming Marvel projects.

The release of Deadpool 3 & Wolverine may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both Deadpool 3 & Wolverine. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady Deadpool 3 & Wolverine (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.

What Is The TVA?

For those who may not be familiar, the Time Variance Authority (TVA) is a bureaucratic agency responsible for monitoring and maintaining the stability of the multiverse. First introduced in the Loki TV series, the TVA oversees various timelines, pruning those deemed problematic to prevent multiversal chaos.

In Deadpool 3 the TVA plays a crucial role as it becomes entangled with Deadpool 3’s and Wolverine’s adventure. Following the events of Deadpool 3's attempt to revive his girlfriend Vanessa and his X-Force team, the TVA’s new rogue agent, Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen), emerges as a key antagonist. Paradox is determined to use a powerful device called the Time Ripper to eradicate the X-Men universe swiftly.

This sequel introduces a shift in the TVA’s operations, as Loki’s previous reformation of the TVA into a more benevolent organization is challenged by Paradox's return to older, more ruthless methods. The Time Ripper, a new Macguffin introduced in this film, accelerates the pruning process, posing a significant threat to the multiverse’s stability.

The TVA’s involvement adds layers of complexity to the plot, blending the bureaucratic and authoritarian elements of the TVA with Deadpool 3’s irreverent antics and Wolverine’s brooding heroism. The movie explores the TVA's impact on the multiverse and how Deadpool 3 must navigate this intricate and dangerous bureaucracy to save their universe from being pruned away.

Deadpool 3 & Wolverine delves into the TVA’s influence and its shifting role in the multiverse, showcasing a clash between old and new ways of maintaining order. The film’s narrative highlights the tension between preserving multiversal stability and the characters' personal stakes, creating a rich backdrop for Deadpool 3’s high-stakes journey.

What Mind Does Deadpool 3 Live In?

In Deadpool 3 the internal landscape of Deadpool 3’s universe is as chaotic and dynamic as the characters themselves. Unlike the structured and emotionally driven world of Riley from Inside Out 2, Deadpool 3's universe reflects the unpredictable and often absurd nature of the multiverse.

In the film, Deadpool 3’s mind is portrayed as a sprawling, disordered realm filled with various quirks and alternate realities. This universe, referred to as the “Deadpool 3 Dimension,” is characterized by its fragmented and sometimes surreal architecture, mirroring Deadpool 3’s unpredictable and irreverent personality.

The narrative explores how Deadpool 3's internal world has been influenced by his adventures and interactions with various characters across the multiverse. The introduction of “Multiversal Fractures” highlights the cracks and inconsistencies in Deadpool 3’s universe caused by constant meddling with time and reality. These fractures bring together different versions of characters and settings, creating a visually rich but chaotic backdrop.

A central plot element in Deadpool 3 & Wolverine is the concept of “Temporal Echoes,” remnants of past decisions and events that resurface to impact the present. These echoes are represented by various alternate versions of Deadpool 3 and his allies, each bringing their own quirks and complications into the mix.

The film introduces the notion of “Reality Anchors,” entities or characters that stabilize different versions of reality. Wolverine, alongside Deadpool 3, becomes a crucial Reality Anchor in the film, helping to manage the instability caused by the rogue TVA agent, Mr. Paradox. Their role involves confronting and rectifying distortions within the multiverse, maintaining a semblance of order amidst the chaos.

A pivotal subplot involves the concept of “Multiversal Nexus Points,” key locations that serve as focal points of reality intersections. These nexus points are critical in understanding the broader implications of Deadpool 3’s actions, particularly as they attempt to thwart Paradox’s plans. The film's climax revolves around a dramatic confrontation at one of these nexus points, where Deadpool 3 must work together to restore balance.

Ultimately, the mind in which Deadpool 3 operates in Deadpool 3 & Wolverine is a vibrant and ever-changing landscape that mirrors the unpredictable nature of the multiverse. The film captures the essence of Deadpool 3’s chaotic adventures while exploring themes of stability and balance within an ever-shifting reality. It underscores the importance of teamwork and resilience in navigating the complexities of a multiverse brimming with anomalies and challenges.

How Do New Emotions Appear In Deadpool 3’s Mind?

In Deadpool 3 the introduction of new emotional and psychological elements into Deadpool 3’s mind is a crucial aspect of the film, reflecting the character's evolution and the complexities of the multiverse. As Deadpool 3 grapples with his place in a new, interconnected reality, his internal landscape becomes more layered and chaotic, prompting the emergence of new emotional and mental constructs.

The catalyst for these new additions is Deadpool 3’s encounter with the Time Variance Authority (TVA) and his subsequent multiverse adventures. These experiences trigger significant shifts in Deadpool 3’s mental state, necessitating the appearance of new psychological elements to help him navigate the challenges posed by his altered reality.

The first new element to emerge is Existential Angst, portrayed by Tessa Thompson. Existential Angst represents Deadpool 3’s struggles with the purpose and meaning of his existence amidst the vastness of the multiverse. This character brings a darker, introspective dimension to Deadpool 3’s psyche, challenging him to confront deeper questions about his role and identity.

Next is Multiversal Doubt, a character brought to life by Oscar Isaac. Multiversal Doubt embodies Deadpool 3’s confusion and uncertainty about the ever-shifting realities and timelines he encounters. This element frequently clashes with Deadpool 3’s irreverent humor, highlighting the tension between his playful exterior and his deeper, more profound anxieties.

Heroic Guilt, voiced by Florence Pugh, is another significant addition. This emotion arises from Deadpool 3’s past actions and decisions, particularly his failures and regrets. Heroic Guilt pushes Deadpool 3 to seek redemption and make amends, driving his quest to save his universe and restore balance.

The emergence of these new elements is facilitated by the “Reality Resonator,” a mechanism within Deadpool 3’s mind activated by his exposure to the TVA’s time-altering technology. The Resonator assesses the impact of Deadpool 3’s experiences and introduces new psychological elements to help him process and adapt to the shifting multiverse.

As these new elements integrate into Deadpool 3’s existing mental framework, they create a more complex internal landscape. Deadpool 3’s interactions with these new elements are central to the film, showcasing his struggle to balance his chaotic nature with the need for introspection and growth. This dynamic highlights the theme of internal conflict and the necessity of facing one’s deeper emotions.

One of the film’s pivotal moments involves a major confrontation with Mr. Paradox, which overwhelms Deadpool 3’s mental equilibrium. The new elements must work alongside Deadpool 3’s established traits—his irreverence, resilience, and humor—to help him navigate the crisis and make sense of his reality. This cooperation underscores the film’s message that understanding and integrating new aspects of one’s psyche is crucial for personal growth and stability.

In conclusion, the introduction of new psychological elements in Deadpool 3 & Wolverine adds depth to Deadpool 3’s character and enriches the narrative. These new constructs reflect his journey through a complex multiverse and his struggle to reconcile his chaotic nature with deeper emotional truths. The film illustrates that as we encounter new challenges and realities, our internal worlds must evolve to accommodate and understand these changes.

Where Do Deadpool 3’s New Psychological Elements Come From?

In Deadpool 3 the emergence of new psychological elements within Deadpool 3's mind marks a pivotal evolution in his character and narrative. These new facets reflect the challenges and complexities of his journey through the multiverse and his evolving role within it.

As Deadpool 3 grapples with the repercussions of his time-travel adventures and encounters with the Time Variance Authority (TVA), his internal world becomes more complex. The introduction of these new psychological elements symbolizes his adaptation to the expanding and chaotic realities he faces.

Existential Angst is the first new element to appear. This psychological construct emerges as Deadpool 3 confronts the vastness and ambiguity of the multiverse. The catalyst for Existential Angst is Deadpool 3’s exposure to various alternate realities and his struggle with the philosophical implications of his existence. It is depicted as a brooding, introspective character that challenges Deadpool 3’s understanding of his purpose and place in the universe.

Following Existential Angst, Multiversal Doubt surfaces. This element materializes in response to Deadpool 3’s encounters with conflicting timelines and realities. Multiversal Doubt represents Deadpool 3’s confusion and uncertainty about the ever-shifting nature of his experiences. It emerges through a “Doubt Distortion,” a phenomenon triggered by Deadpool 3’s encounters with paradoxes and inconsistencies within the multiverse.

Heroic Guilt is the third new psychological element to emerge. This character appears as Deadpool 3 reflects on his past actions and their consequences. Heroic Guilt arises from Deadpool 3’s sense of responsibility and regret regarding his previous failures and mistakes. It is introduced through a “Guilt Resonance,” activated by Deadpool 3’s introspection and desire for redemption.

The emergence of these new psychological elements is facilitated by the “Reality Resonator,” a device within Deadpool 3’s mind that responds to his exposure to multiverse disturbances and time anomalies. The Resonator assesses the impact of Deadpool 3’s experiences and introduces new elements to help him cope with his evolving mental state.

As these new psychological elements integrate into Deadpool 3’s existing mental framework, they create a more intricate internal landscape. Deadpool 3’s interactions with these elements are central to the film, highlighting his struggle to balance his chaotic nature with the deeper emotional and existential challenges he faces. This dynamic underscores the theme of internal conflict and growth.

A significant moment in the film involves a major crisis—such as a pivotal confrontation with Mr. Paradox—that overwhelms Deadpool 3’s mental equilibrium. The new elements must work in conjunction with Deadpool 3’s established traits—his irreverent humor, resilience, and determination—to help him navigate the crisis and find clarity.

In essence, the introduction of new psychological elements in Deadpool 3 & Wolverine enriches Deadpool 3’s character and narrative. These new constructs reflect his journey through a complex multiverse and his struggle to reconcile his chaotic nature with deeper emotional and existential truths. The film illustrates how facing new challenges and realities can lead to profound personal growth and self-awareness.

How Do The New Psychological Elements Impact Deadpool 3’s Life?

In Deadpool 3 the introduction of new psychological elements—Existential Angst, Multiversal Doubt, and Heroic Guilt—significantly impacts Deadpool 3’s mental state and his experiences throughout the film. These new facets are integral to his journey, shaping how he navigates the complexities of his adventures across the multiverse.

Existential Angst introduces a new layer of introspection and philosophical questioning to Deadpool 3’s psyche. As he encounters the vast and chaotic nature of the multiverse, Existential Angst forces him to confront deep questions about his purpose and existence. This element drives Deadpool 3 to reflect on his past actions and their broader implications. The presence of Existential Angst makes Deadpool 3 more contemplative and less impulsive, adding depth to his character as he struggles with the concept of meaning in a seemingly random and interconnected multiverse.

Multiversal Doubt emerges as Deadpool 3 faces the contradictions and paradoxes inherent in traveling through multiple realities. This element causes him to question the reliability of his experiences and the consistency of his own identity. Multiversal Doubt impacts Deadpool 3’s confidence in his actions and decisions, creating moments of uncertainty and hesitation. This internal conflict adds tension to his interactions with other characters, including Wolverine, and challenges him to find clarity amidst the confusion of alternate realities.

Heroic Guilt becomes a significant emotional force as Deadpool 3 reflects on the consequences of his past decisions and their effects on those around him. This element amplifies Deadpool 3’s sense of responsibility and regret, driving him to seek redemption and make amends. Heroic Guilt influences his actions and motivations, making him more driven to rectify his past mistakes and to protect those he cares about. This quest for redemption adds a layer of emotional complexity to Deadpool 3’s character and deepens his relationship with Wolverine.

The interplay between these new psychological elements and Deadpool 3’s established traits—his irreverent humor, resilience, and chaotic nature—creates a rich and dynamic internal landscape. As Deadpool 3 grapples with Existential Angst, Multiversal Doubt, and Heroic Guilt, he must balance these new challenges with his existing personality and the chaotic circumstances of his multiversal adventures.

A crucial moment in the film involves a major emotional and psychological crisis, such as a confrontation with Mr. Paradox or a pivotal choice affecting the multiverse. During this crisis, Deadpool 3 must integrate his new psychological elements with his established traits to overcome the challenge and achieve his goals. The collaboration between these elements highlights the film’s theme of personal growth and the importance of facing and understanding one’s inner conflicts.

As Deadpool 3 navigates his new psychological reality, he learns to balance and integrate these new facets with his existing traits. This process of integration contributes to his personal development and helps him adapt to the complex realities of the multiverse. The film underscores that confronting and understanding new psychological dimensions is essential for growth and resilience.

In conclusion, Deadpool 3 & Wolverine explores the profound impact of new psychological elements on Deadpool 3’s life. Existential Angst, Multiversal Doubt, and Heroic Guilt play crucial roles in shaping his character and guiding his journey through the multiverse. These new facets add depth to Deadpool 3’s internal struggle, contributing to his development and the overarching narrative of self-discovery and redemption.
